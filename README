Virtual California is a computer simulation which models the earthquake fault
system in California. It uses field observations to define fault topology,
long-term slip rates and frictional parameters. The faults are meshed into
fault-segments and quasi-static elastic interactions are calculated between
these segments. Slip is then applied to each segment at geologically-observed
rates until stress values exceed the frictional parameters. At this point the
segment will break and transfer stress to the rest of the system via the
quasi-static interactions described above. Under the correct conditions,
transferred stress results in propagating ruptures throughout the system, i.e. a
simulated earthquake. The design of Virtual California allows for fast execution
so many thousands of events can be generated over very long simulated time
periods. The result is a rich dataset from which to study the statistical
properties of the rupturing fault system.

== INSTALLATION ==
 
 See the INSTALL file.
 
== TESTING ==

 After following the instructions in INSTALL, before you move any files around. From
 within the 'test' directory just run the 'run_test' script:
 
 ./run_test
 
 Virtual California will run a small simulation creating the files:
 
 test_greens.h5 - The interaction matrices.
 test_dyn-0-5_st-5.h5 - The simulation file.
 block_info.dat - A element mapping file.
