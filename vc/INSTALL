== Windows ==

 This is untested so use at your own risk!

 If using Cygwin:
    
    ./configure
    make
    make install
    
 If using Visual Studio:
 
    Follow the directions at the link for running CMake on Windows:
    http://www.opentissue.org/wikitissue/index.php/Using_CMake
    
    NOTE: Select the "build" folder as the location to build the binaries.
    
== Mac OS X ==
 
 With the OS X default python.

 ./configure
 cd build
 make
 sudo make install
 
 If you have a third party installation of python (ie. from homebrew or macports) Virtual California will build
 and install, but the python quakelib module may not work. This is because cmake
 builds against the system python. To fix this do the following:
 
 ./configure
    cmake will output the following:
	"-- Found PythonLibs: /usr/lib/libpythonx.x.dylib"
	where "x.x" is a version number (ie. "2.7"). We need to move this file and 
	create a link to the correct python.
 sudo mv /usr/lib/libpythonx.x.dylib /usr/lib/libpythonx.x.sys.dylib
 which python
    This will output /the/path/to/python.
 otool -L /the/path/to/python
	This will output /the/path/to/python/library.
 sudo ln -s /the/path/to/python/library /usr/lib/libpythonx.x.dylib
 rm -r build/
 ./configure
 cd build
 make
 sudo make install

== Linux ==

 ./configure
 cd build
 make
 sudo make install
 
== INSTALL LOCATIONS ==

 Quakelib libraries will be installed in standandard library directories based on your system configuration.
 Cmake will generate a file named "install_manifest.txt" in the build directory detailing the locations of installed
 files. The Virtual California binary is build/src/vc.
 
== CLEAN RE-BUILD ==

 Just delete the build directory and re-install based on the instructions above.
